#### Introduction
This application sets out to visualize the effects of the new traffic separation schemes (TSS) and speed regulations instituted in the Gulf of Panama by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on December 1st, 2014. These policies sought to protect humpback whales, which breed in the Gulf in the late summer, from fatal vessel strikes. The primary effects of these regulations were: <br> <br>
(1) The year-round institution of inbound and outbound traffic lanes through the Gulf (represented in blue). Prior to the institution of these policies, vessels could travel freely throughout the Gulf. Currently, all vessels are bound to stay within the geographic bounds of the TSS at all times. <br> <br>
(2) The reduction of the speed limit for all ships from 14 knots to 10 knots above 8ºN from August 1st through November 30th of each year.


#### The Data
The data presented herein, obtained from Vessel Finder Ltd., contains point observations, taken at five minute intervals, of vessel speed, heading, and location in the Gulf of Panama from latitude 7.41667ºN to 8.8ºN. The data spans two years from December 1st, 2013, 1 year before, to December 1st, 2015, 1 year after institution of the policies. Grouping points by their time of observation and direction of travel, individual vessel paths through the Gulf are compiled and presented in yellow if the trip occurred before December 1st, 2014, and in red if the trip occurred after.

#### Problems with the Data
A major issue with the data is that observations are heavily clustered in the Northernmost and, to a lesser extent, Southwesternmost regions of the Gulf. It seems likely that the limited range of shoreside monitoring centers, possibly located at the Southwest entry to the Gulf and near the mouth of the canal, has resulted in this geographic skew. The result of this is that very few observations are available through much of the middle of the geographic distribution. Further,
any observations South of 82ºN were incredibly scarce prior to the implementation of the policy.
This geographic skew, in concert with the fact that geographic skew is temporally inconsistent, may adversely affect analysis of speed data over time and across latitudes.

#### Using the App
To learn more about each individual tool, click the information icon to the right of that tool's header. In the case of the plot at the bottom of the menu, the information icon is located to the bottom right. It is recommended that you read through all tooltips prior to using the app.

#### Conclusions
While further analysis is necessary, this data appears to suggest that geographic compliance with the 2014 TSS has been good, while compliance with the speed regulations has been poor. Better monitoring of vessel speeds and more stringent enforcement may be needed.
